          - Build and train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters,
          implement vectorized neural networks and deep learning to applications. <br/>
          - Train test sets, analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques and optimization algorithms,
          and build neural networks in TensorFlow. <br/>
          - Build a CNN and apply it to detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art,
          and apply algorithms to image and video data. <br/>
          - Build and train RNNs, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and
          transformer models to perform NER and Question Answering.

          Once the certificate is obtained, developers can join our network
          of certified specialists and add their certificate and badges on their CV,
          on GitHub and on social media platforms like LinkedIn to share their mastery
          of TensorFlow to the whole world.
